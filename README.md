# Pointshop2 Crafting
A small Pointshop2 Crafting Script

With this Addon, you can let your Players Craft Items (and Points) to another Items Ingame. Directly inside Pointshop2.

Installation:<br>
Just Drag´n Drop "ps2-craftings" in your Addons Folder<br>
<br>
Copy (out of this branch):
pointshop2\lua\ps2\modules\ <br>
Place it into (your Server): addons\pointshop2\lua\ps2\modules\<br>

Should now look like: \pointshop2\lua\ps2\modules\craftings\sh_module.lua<br><br>
Replace pointshop2\lua\ps2\client\cl_0_pointshop2.lua<br>
with: https://pastebin.com/J32as0ap <br>
Open your Console (as superadmin) and write: craftings_admin<br>

<br>
A Crafting Tab will open. 
<br>You´re good to go
